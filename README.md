# How to play
Firstly, find a buddy and go to https://polar-chamber-54098.herokuapp.com. Click 'Play', choose an avatar and the game will begin. On each turn, a dice will roll; the dice number that is presented is the amount of damage a correct (or wrong) answer can inflict on a player. You will directly be competing with your opponent to answer the question.

Both players have 10 seconds to answer the question. If a player answers the question correctly, the opposing player will be dealt damage equal to the dice number. Answering a question incorrectly will inflict self-damage equal to the dice number. Failure of either player to answer a question within 10 seconds means a new turn is initiated without any of the players having damage inflicted.

The first player to have their health reach 0 is the loser, whilst their opponent is the winner. There are a total of 60 questions included, so it's likely that you'll get some repeats unfortunately. Good luck!
